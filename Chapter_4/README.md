# Chapter 4 (allcast) code

Code used to produce Monte Carlo simulations for ARQ and RLNC in my PhD thesis.

The script is written in Python, using the NUMBA package to take advantage of GPGPU on nVIDIA cards
(required for producing simulations). The code may be used to generate graphs from existing data
using appropriate command line parameters. The code may contain graphs which did not appear in the
thesis.
